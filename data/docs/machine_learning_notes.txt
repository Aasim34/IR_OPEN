Machine Learning Fundamentals

Introduction
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning

1. Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. Each training example consists of an input and the desired output.

Common Algorithms:
- Linear Regression: Predicts continuous values
- Logistic Regression: Binary classification
- Decision Trees: Tree-based classification and regression
- Random Forests: Ensemble of decision trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): Finds optimal separating hyperplane
- Neural Networks: Multi-layer perceptrons for complex patterns

Applications:
- Image classification
- Spam detection
- Price prediction
- Medical diagnosis

2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labeled outputs.

Common Algorithms:
- K-Means Clustering: Groups similar data points
- Hierarchical Clustering: Creates tree of clusters
- DBSCAN: Density-based clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Dimensionality reduction
- Autoencoders: Neural networks for feature learning

Applications:
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation systems
- Data compression

3. Reinforcement Learning
An agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

Key Concepts:
- Agent: The learner or decision maker
- Environment: What the agent interacts with
- State: Current situation of the agent
- Action: What the agent can do
- Reward: Feedback from the environment

Applications:
- Game playing (Chess, Go, video games)
- Robotics
- Self-driving cars
- Resource management

Key Concepts in Machine Learning

Feature Engineering
The process of selecting, transforming, and creating features from raw data:
- Feature Selection: Choosing relevant features
- Feature Extraction: Creating new features from existing ones
- Feature Scaling: Normalizing or standardizing values
- One-Hot Encoding: Converting categorical variables

Model Training
The process of learning patterns from data:
- Training Set: Data used to train the model
- Validation Set: Data used to tune hyperparameters
- Test Set: Data used to evaluate final performance
- Epochs: Number of times algorithm sees entire dataset
- Batch Size: Number of samples processed before updating

Overfitting and Underfitting
- Overfitting: Model learns training data too well, poor generalization
- Underfitting: Model too simple to capture patterns
- Solutions: Regularization, cross-validation, more data, simpler models

Regularization Techniques
Methods to prevent overfitting:
- L1 Regularization (Lasso): Adds absolute value of coefficients
- L2 Regularization (Ridge): Adds squared value of coefficients
- Dropout: Randomly drops neurons during training
- Early Stopping: Stop training when validation performance degrades

Evaluation Metrics

Classification Metrics:
- Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions
- Precision: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- Recall: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- ROC-AUC: Area under receiver operating characteristic curve
- Confusion Matrix: Shows true/false positives/negatives

Regression Metrics:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of squared differences
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of MSE
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average of absolute differences
- R-squared: Proportion of variance explained

Deep Learning

Neural Network Architecture:
- Input Layer: Receives features
- Hidden Layers: Learn representations
- Output Layer: Produces predictions
- Activation Functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax

Popular Deep Learning Models:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Sequential data
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Long sequences
- Transformers: State-of-the-art for NLP
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Generate new data

Optimization Algorithms

Gradient Descent Variants:
- Batch Gradient Descent: Uses entire dataset
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Uses one sample at a time
- Mini-batch Gradient Descent: Uses small batches
- Adam: Adaptive learning rates
- RMSprop: Root mean square propagation
- AdaGrad: Adaptive gradient algorithm

Best Practices

Data Preparation:
